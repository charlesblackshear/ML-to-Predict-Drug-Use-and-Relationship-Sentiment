# ML to Predict Drug Use and Relationship Sentiment

Social media profiles provide abundant demographic, behavioral and meta- data, particularly those related to services intended to match individuals with would-be companions. Such is the intention of the large data set used in this analysis (courtesy of Codecademy in 2018), from a major online dating website. This projects demonstrates that habits are predictive of other habits; specifically, smoking and drinking predict drug use, as one would expect. However, less intuitively, this data set demonstrates that drinkers of all levels who smoke less engage in more drug use. The analysis proceeds with a second question: Does relationship sentiment (i.e. casual vs serious) predict age? These data support the intuition that younger individuals prefer less commital relationships.
